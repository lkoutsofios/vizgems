# this shell script specifies the host to get timing information from
# the variable TIMESYS must be set to either 'NONE' for no time checks
# or to a QUOTED, SPACE-SEPARATED line of the form:
#     "user1@server1[:port]"
# where:
#     'user' is the user name on the remote system
#     'server' is the name or ip address of the remote system
#     'port' (optional) is the ssh port of the remote system
# example:
#     TIMESYS="swift@alpems"
# NOTE: this mechanism uses SSH to copy data, so SSH to the remote
# system must be enabled
# if this scope is time synced through ntp or the windows protocol,
# this variable should be left set to NONE.

TIMESYS=NONE
