# data to. it must set the variables ALARMSYS CLEARSYS STATSYS
# to either 'NONE' for no propagation or to a QUOTED, SPACE-SEPARATED
# line of the form:
#     "user1@server1:[port:]dir1 user2@server2:[port:]dir2 ..."
# where:
#     'user' is the user name on the remote system
#     'server' is the name or ip address of the remote system
#     'port' (optional) is the ssh port of the remote system
#     'dir' is the directory name to upload to
# example:
#     ALARMSYS="alpweb1:/export/home/swift/vizgems/data/system/incoming"
#     CLEARSYS="swift@alpweb2:/export/home/swift/vizgems/data/system/incoming"
# NOTE: this mechanism uses SSH to copy data, so SSH to these remote
# systems must be enabled
# POLLING: if the EMS is supposed to poll this scope, use HOLD4POLL as the
# user name. the server name must be exactly the official name of the EMS
