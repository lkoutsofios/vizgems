# this shell script specifies the list of locations to upload
# data to. it must set the variables ALARMSYS CLEARSYS STATSYS EMAILSYS
# to either 'NONE' for no propagation or to a QUOTED, SPACE-SEPARATED
# line of the form:
#     "user1@server1:[port:]dir1 user2@server2:[port:]dir2 ..."
# where:
#     'user' is the user name on the remote system
#     'server' is the name or ip address of the remote system
#     'port' (optional) is the ssh port of the remote system
#     'dir' is the directory name to upload to
# example:
#     ALARMSYS="alpweb1:/export/home/swift/vizgems/data/system/incoming"
#     CLEARSYS="swift@alpweb2:/export/home/swift/vizgems/data/system/incoming"

# systems to send alarm clear records to

# control the sending emails of alarms

# propagation parameters
# NOTE: setting any parameters increases the load on the system
# use only when absolutely necessary
#
# when a remote server must receive only a subset of all the data on this
# server, the following variables can be set to specify the constraints of
# the feed.
# the subscripts in these arrays must match the user and server strings
# for this feed:
#
# STATPARAMS["user1@server1"]=(
#   level_c="acme|att"
#   level_o="abc123"
# )
# there should be only one entry per asset level (c, o, etc)
#
# the configuration manager parameters support an exclude field
# set that field to a space separated list of file types to prevent
# files of that type from being propagated:
#
# CMPARAMS["user1@server1"]=(
#   exclude='business customer passwd group account'
# )
# currently the supported file types are:
# filter alarmemail profile threshold favorites passwd group account
# preferences customer business location type
