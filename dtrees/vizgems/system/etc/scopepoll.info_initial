# this shell script specifies the list of scopes to upload data from.
# it must set the variable POLLSYS to either 'NONE' for no uploads,
# to a QUOTED, SPACE-SEPARATED line of the form:
#     "user1@server1:[port:]dir1 user2@server2:[port:]dir2 ..."
# where:
#     'user' is the user name on the scope
#     'server' is the name or ip address of the scope
#     'port' (optional) is the ssh port on the scope
#     'dir' is the remote directory name to search for data
# example:
#     POLLSYS="scope@unixscope:/export/home/swift/vizgems/data/scopes/outgoing"
# NOTE: this mechanism uses SSH to copy data, so SSH to these remote
# systems must be enabled

# systems to poll
POLLSYS=NONE
